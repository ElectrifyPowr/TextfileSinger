# TextfileSinger
## To let your terminal sing!!!

This is a basic bash script that takes any text file as input and then uses a Text-To-Speech (TTS) functionality to say each line.

For fun and testing purposes a basic christmas song was added ðŸŽ…ðŸ˜„

Usage:
```./textfilesinger.sh merrychristmas.txt```


## Notes

This is a basic bash script that uses the **say** functionality of the Mac OS.
In case you're running this script on a **different OS, replace the 'say' command** with a suitable command for your specific OS.
